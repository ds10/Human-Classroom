			<h2>A playful test in Social Simulation and storytelling</h2>

			<p>Human Classroom is a space to play, learn and start to explore the possibilities creating a backend to a tool that can model the impact interventions.</p>	
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<br/>
			Human Classroom grew out of an idea that we could model classroom scenarios and the impact that interventions could have on these scenarios. Worried about the complexities of people but
		    impressed with the complex nature social of social interactions in games I wanted to start to play with creating a non graphic simulation tool that could eventually be incorporated into a
		    more serious simulation.
			<br/><br/>
			<h3>Note</h3>
			<br/>
			HC is a space for to learn, but is also built for entertainment (for me :-) ). I hope to take lessons learnt into something more serious, but for now don't things too seriously!
